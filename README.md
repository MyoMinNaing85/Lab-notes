# Lab-notes

A living notebook for research, experiments, and evolving ideas.

This repository is part of **impermanence-labs** —  
an exploration of impermanence through code, systems, and research.

## Purpose
- Capture raw ideas and questions
- Document experiments and observations
- Think in public, refine in private

## Structure (evolving)
- `notes/` — research notes & reflections
- `experiments/` — small tests and prototypes
- `ideas/` — unfinished thoughts and questions

## Philosophy
Nothing here is final.  
Everything is subject to change.
